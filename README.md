# Chrome-Extension-Motivational-Cute-Dog-Images

The point of the extension is to provide images of cute dogs
when the button in the popup.html file is clicked. Everytime
the button is clicked a random image name from an array is picked.

Currently there is a total of five images that can be randomly picked
by pressing the button.

This extension will keep the user motivated throughout the day!
